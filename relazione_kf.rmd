## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{python}
from kalman_filter.kalman import kalman_filter
from kalman_filter.kalman_sim import kalman_simulation
import numpy as np
import random
print(inspect.getsource(kalman_filter))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{python}
random.seed("esperimento 1")

kalman_simulation(
    iterations=30,
    real_state=np.array([0, 2]).reshape(2, 1),
    real_state_cov=np.diag([10, 2]),
    real_sensor_cov=np.diag([40, 2]),
    pnoise_cov=np.diag([0, 2]),
    acceleration=1,
)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
